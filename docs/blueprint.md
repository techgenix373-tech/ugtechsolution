## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), drawing inspiration from the bright blue dot in the company logo, symbolizing innovation and a modern tech focus. The use of electric blue reflects both the tech and solution aspects.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) provides a neutral backdrop to make content and vibrant blue elements stand out, enhancing readability and overall user experience. Dark text is mandatory for this to work.
- Accent color: A vivid, saturated teal (#008080), positioned as an analogous color to the electric blue, adding depth and visual interest while still aligning with the tech-focused color scheme. Used sparingly for calls to action and key highlights.
- Body text and headline font: 'PT Sans' is a humanist sans-serif combining modernity and warmth for an approachable yet professional feel.
- Employ a set of simple, modern icons that visually represent each service offering, reinforcing the message and enhancing usability. Icons are a light gray.
- Utilize a clean and structured layout, incorporating plenty of white space to create a professional and easy-to-navigate interface, emphasizing clarity and user experience.
- Implement subtle, modern animations such as fade-ins and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience without overwhelming the user.
